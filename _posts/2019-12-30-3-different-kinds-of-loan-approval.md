When you’re getting ready to buy a home, there are three levels of loan approval that you can go through:

**Pre-qualification:** This can be completed after a simple telephone conversation and is given based on conversation.

**Pre-approval:** This actually involves a credit pull and turning in some income and asset documentation.

**Full credit underwriting approval:** This is an approval with a full application, credit report, income and asset documents, and vetted by a professional underwriter. This level of approval is critically important to having success in a hyper-competitive housing market like ours. **If you aren’t working with a loan officer who is getting you a full credit underwriting approval, you need to find a new one.**
