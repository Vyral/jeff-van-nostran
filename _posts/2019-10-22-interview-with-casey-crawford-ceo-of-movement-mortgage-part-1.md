Today I’m interviewing Casey Crawford, the CEO of Movement Mortgage. This is only part one of a three-part series\! I’m excited to have Casey here with me today. I’ve been mostly silent on social media in recent weeks, so I thought what better way to have a coming-out party and announce that I’ve made a great change to go to work for Movement Mortgage than to do an interview with the CEO. So let’s jump right in\!

**Who is Movement Mortgage?**&nbsp;

Movement Mortgage is a community of over 3,000 passionate professionals who are working together to be a movement of change in the housing industry by delivering a new story to home finance of caring about our customers, teammates, and the communities that we’re a part of.&nbsp;

**If I’m a consumer, why do I want to do business with Movement Mortgage?**

We built Movement Mortgage in 2008 in the depth of the financial crisis. We observed that fundamentally Americans were not being served well in the homeownership process. Banks and many other financial institutions were known for how they had taken advantage of the trust of the American consumer. We thought there may be a new, improved story written at that time.&nbsp;

We built a movement to do just that, to care for and serve homebuyers across America as they look to purchase or refinance their homes. We added one passionate professional at a time over the last decade until we had a little over 3,000 people. We’re now financing about one out of every 70 homes in America. It’s remained as a movement of change, a new way of approaching serving homebuyers across America, so you can know you are working with a company that was constructed wholly for you by people who were passionate about restoring American’s faith and trust in financial service institutions.&nbsp;

**Part two of my interview with Casey Crawford, the CEO of Movement Mortgage is coming soon,** so please check back\!
