As we wrapped up one of our events in downtown Miami, it got me thinking about this year’s Super Bowl. This year’s teams were chock-full of elite players at every position. **Like football, real estate is a team sport, too.** And as an agent, you are who you surround yourself with; your team wins and loses in this marketplace based on the expertise and quality of service and communication that you provide your clients. You need a team of inspectors, interior designers, landscapers, lenders, and more to complete the puzzle and compete at the highest level.

If you’re anything like me, you’re hyper-competitive. I like to live vicariously through my clients, and **I want each one of them to compete and win the home of their dreams.&nbsp;**

2020 isn’t just a new year, it’s a new decade. Now’s a great time to act as the general manager of your team. Evaluate each professional on your team and do an objective analysis to see if they’re the best of the best. Does your team go out on the field each day in this housing market and give it their all?

On the lending side, figure out for yourself if there’s room for someone like me to bring added value to your world. Many of the agents I’ve talked to in the past are stuck in their ways, having worked with a specific lender for a long time whom they swear is the best and can do no wrong. I’m close friends with many of my agent partners too, but at the end of the day, this is business. Real estate is a cutthroat game where there are winners and losers.

If you want a winner, **get a lender who will go out and compete on behalf of your clients.** Don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Let’s carry the conversation further and see if we’re a good fit to work together.
