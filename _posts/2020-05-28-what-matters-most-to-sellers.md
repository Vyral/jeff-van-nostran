A lot of homebuyers think that qualifications like credit profile, income, and down payment percentage make all of the difference to sellers and help them stand out from the competition.&nbsp;

As an industry professional who’s been doing mortgage lending for over a decade, I’m here to tell you that those things don’t matter. Sellers don’t care about them. What they do care about is getting top dollar for their property. They want the highest bidder.&nbsp;

The second-most important thing to sellers, though, is **a buyer who’s aligned themselves with the right lender and agent.** These professionals will take them from the starting line to the finish line.&nbsp;

When a seller sits down and spreads their offers out over the table, the listing agent they hired as their advisor will help them choose one winner and a lot of losers. If you plan on winning, you need to align yourself with a Realtor and loan officer who have a reputation for competing and winning.&nbsp;

Not just that, but **you also need a lender who can take you from the starting line to the finish line as quickly as possible,** with no surprises or hiccups and clear communication. A full underwriting approval will also differentiate you from other buyers. A lot of buyers are throwing around pre-approval letters, but those letters are issued based on loan officer expertise.&nbsp;

There’s no housing inventory, so why not take your time, get your ducks in a row, and have your lender take you through the full underwriting department process and help you stand out from the competition?

If you work with me, we will compete and win.&nbsp;
