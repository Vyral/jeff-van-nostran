Welcome back to the third and final installment of my interview with Movement Mortgage CEO Casey Crawford. This time, he answered perhaps the most interesting question of our series:&nbsp;

***What makes Movement Mortgage different from other lending companies out there?***

In his response to this, Casey first replied with one simple word: love.

“We exist to love and value people,” says Casey, who went on to explain that what he means by “love” in this context is to “act in the long-term best interest of another \[person\].”&nbsp;

And, as a mortgage lender, Casey explains that the way he and his company express this love is by quickly and accurately processing each loan, keeping in mind their clients’ best interests at every single step of the way.&nbsp;
