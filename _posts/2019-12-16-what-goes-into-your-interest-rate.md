A common question that I hear from clients is, “What’s your rate?” I think it’s a silly question because I don’t have any context to go off of. Are they looking to buy a single-family home, condo, or a townhome? Do they want to make a purchase, a refinance, or a cash-out refinance? Are we talking about a 30-year fixed, 5-year ARM, or interest-only loan? There are so many factors that make up your rate, including your debt-to-income ratio, your credit score, and much more. Asking “What’s your rate?” is like going to a doctor and asking them your blood type before they even take your blood.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
